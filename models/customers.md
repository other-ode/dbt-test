{% docs customers %}

Write a test that fails, for example, omit one of the order statuses in the accepted*values list. What does a failing test look like? Can you debug the failure?
Run the tests for one model only. If you grouped your stg* models into a directory, try running the tests for all the models in that directory.
Use a docs block to add a Markdown description to a model.
